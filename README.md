BeatThreads
===========

For completion of requirements for Creative Programming for Digital 
Media & Mobile Apps at Coursera.

This is the product of the developer playing around with the gravity of
the world. Whenever the user presses the mouse down, the balls will
move towards the direction of the mouse. As you move the mouse around,
the balls will form threads on the screen. The color of the balls will
also change to the beat of the music.

The music used was taken from the following link:
* https://www.freesound.org/people/bigjoedrummer/sounds/77293/

I chose a rock beat because the beat is more obvious to our ears.

Known bug: There is a chance that the balls will not move when the
mouse is presses. The developer is not sure why this happens.
